Sinkkala is a cottage with good ol’ granny’s atmosphere, located at green countryside. The large yard is overshadowed by aged trees, and surrounded by old household constructions creating its own peaceful setting. Neighbors are close, but far enough for privacy. The garden is relaxing, and spacious for children to play and run around.

Sinkkala is open all year round. You may choose to stay just for one night, or a longer period of time. The beds are made for you, and you can enjoy breakfast in the kitchen at your convenience. We offer free wireless Internet access. Also available in the common area are radio and TV with DVD-player. It also possible to rent the whole house for you and your company to enjoy.

You’ll find it easy to travel to Sinkkala. Main road (#55) is just about 500 meters away. The city of Porvoo is only 10 kilometers away, and Helsinki — the capital city of Finland — is at distance of 60 kilometers. You’ll find more detailed information from the <a href="#">Contact</a>-page.

Welcome!
